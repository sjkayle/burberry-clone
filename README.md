# Burberry MY Landing Page Clone

This application is a simple static clone of the landing page of the [Burberry Malaysia](https://my.burberry.com/) website.

I started this project in order for me to learn how to implement [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), an animation library for React that I recently discovered, in my future projects. I tried to mimic the design and animations from the original page as closely as possible.

_All content and design belongs to Burberry._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
